# Cheryblast_plus_ob Program

## Overview  
The Cheryblast_plus_ob program is designed for 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing to identify 37 bacteria associated with community-acquired pneumonia, achieving 99.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. It differentiates **S. pneumoniae** from Î±-hemolytic streptococci, is robust against intra-species 16S ribosomal RNA variations and sequencing errors, and supports the Battlefield Hypothesis by distinguishing pathogens from commensals.  

## Installation

2. Ruby 3.0 or later is required to run the program (https://www.ruby-lang.org).
